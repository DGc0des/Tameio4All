# Tameio4All

Configurable, sellable version of tameioV2 (cash-register closing). Design:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-28-tameio4all-v1-design.md`. Plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Architecture
- `src/core/` — pure TypeScript money logic. No packages, no DOM, no Supabase. Every UI and
  report computes through these functions. The purity rule (imports stay inside `src/core`, no
  browser globals) is enforced by the test `tests/core-purity.test.ts` — a Vitest check that scans
  the real source files, not a linter/eslint rule. There is no lint step in this repo.
- (Plan 2+) `src/features/` UI, `src/data/` Supabase access (the one mutation path),
  `supabase/migrations/` schema + RLS + RPCs.

## Invariants
- Money is integer cents everywhere in core. Parse with `parseAmount`, show with `formatCents`.
- `ShopConfig` and `ClosingInputs` both carry a `schema: 1` field (day-zero identifier). Bump it
  whenever the stored shape changes; validators reject a mismatched/missing schema as `bad_shape`.
- Configs and closing inputs are read back as JSON (jsonb / stored rows), so `validateConfig` and
  `validateClosingInputs` both accept `unknown` and never throw on foreign input — they report
  structural problems as `bad_shape`/`bad_id`/`bad_label`/etc. instead. `isShopConfig(x)` is the
  `unknown` → `ShopConfig` type guard built on `validateConfig`.
- Totals are computed only by `evaluateTotals(config, inputs)`. Closings will store raw inputs +
  `config_id`, never totals (staff cannot fake a total; old closings keep their formulas).
- Shop configs are immutable versions; a new version is a new row.
- A config must pass `validateConfig` before use; `evaluateTotals` throws `ConfigInvalidError`
  otherwise, then `ClosingInputsInvalidError` if `validateClosingInputs` finds a problem.
- Envelope (Φάκελος) is computed only by `planEnvelope`, fed computed totals — never UI text.
  Exact up to ~20 000€ (`MAX_UNITS` at 5c units); best-effort above that.
- Staff/PINs are never part of `ShopConfig` (server-side table only).
- No shop's data ships in the code: expense suggestions are learned per shop from its own submitted
  expense lines via `buildSupplierHistory` (30 most recent amounts per supplier). Never add a
  hardcoded supplier list.

## Conventions
- Code/comments English, UI Greek. Tests in `tests/`, importing real core functions.
- `npm test`, `npm run typecheck` must pass before every commit.
